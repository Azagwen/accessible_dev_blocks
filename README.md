# Accessible Developer Blocks

## About
A small fabric mod that makes vanilla developer blocks easier to access, with a dedicated creative tab and a structure void utility.

# Features
## Structure void visibility switch
By default set to F4 it allows you to toggle structure void between visible and invisible, when visible they will act like Barrier blocks and have their hitboxes the size of a full block, when hidden their hitbox is removed and their particles stop showing.


## Developer blocks creative tab
Contains the 4 types of command bloks, structure and jigsaw blocks, the debug stick, barrier blocks and structure void. Aims to make all of these features easier to access in creative.

## Structure void and Barrier block texture revamp
For my eye's sake and sanity.
